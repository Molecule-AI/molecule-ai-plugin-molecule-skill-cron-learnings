"""Hermes adaptor — uses the generic rule+skill installer.

Hermes loads skills from /configs/skills/ via the shared skill_loader,
which is runtime-agnostic. The AgentskillsAdaptor wires rules, skills,
hooks, and commands for Claude Code-style harness environments. For Hermes,
the same adaptor handles rules and skills; hooks/commands are no-ops
that Hermes ignores gracefully.
